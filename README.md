# Ball Launcher Game

This project is a simple game developed using Unity and C#. In this game, you launch a red ball to hit blocks by pulling it back like a slingshot. This game was developed with guidance from a Udemy course.


## Gameplay

- The game starts directly, and you immediately begin launching the ball.
- Pull back the red ball to hit and destroy the blocks.
- After the ball is launched, a new ball is automatically instantiated, and this process continues as long as you keep launching balls.
- Even if all blocks are destroyed, a new ball will be produced as long as the launching continues.


## Features

- Pull the ball back like a slingshot to hit the blocks.
- No levels, menus, or exit options are available.
- The game starts directly and is ready to play.
- Utilizes Cinemachine Dynamic Zone for compatibility across mobile devices, ensuring the game works on both tablets and phones.
- Includes a `Prefabs` folder under the `Assets` directory, where the `Ball` prefab is added. After the ball is launched, a new ball is automatically instantiated using the `Instantiate` method.
